# _UrbanCode_ - _RapidDeploy_ plugin
A _UrbanCode_ plugin to manage _RapidDeploy_ features.

## Dependencies
* The [_RapidDeploy_ connector](https://github.com/MidVision/rapiddeploy-connector) project.
  * It is all set up in the _POM_ file so there's no need to configure any extra thing.

## Building
* Using _Maven_ just by running:
```
mvn package
```
The resulting _XML_ file in the _target_ folder can already be used as a plugin file for _UrbanCode_.
